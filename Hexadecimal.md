## Hexadecimal 

# Background 

- when talking about hexadecimal system which is somewhat like the the binary system and the octals system is the binary code value was made up of more than just 1s and 0s just like the binary becasue of the fact that it included letters aswell it was mad this way so people could understand the code better becasue there are more values

- The base numbers of this system is 16 meaning that the number 16 which is a constant has a power meaning in eaxh space lets say 4 or three there is a power like 16^2 16^1 16^0 and it all depends on how many digits you have 

- when we look at the list of numbers for this systemj it goes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,89,A,B,C,D,E,F that is 16 different symbols and 16 different values becasue beside that is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 and each letter from A to F starts at 10 to 15 meaning if A was chossen then i would have to convert it to the value which A holds which would be 10

here is a diagram that list the symbols and their values 

Hexadecimal

0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	A	B	C	D	E	F

Decimal
0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15

- so lets say i make a code 8FA when converting that The value of F would be 15  and the value of A would be 10 so we would compute this: 8 * 16^2 + 15 * 16^1 + 10 * 16^0 = 2298
