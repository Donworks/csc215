### Part 1

## Introduction 

- In the introduction it mainly explains the fact that most users can use this computer even if you come from a background of electronics or coding it dosent matter which one is stronger.

## Logic

- There is a mathematician named George boole who studied the relationship between certain fundemental logical expressions and their arithmetic counterparts and in 1847 he published a book called the Mathematical analysis of logic he came out with more info in 1854 most computer electronics work based off this logic and the concepts boole has explanied

- The boolean system is known by most people as boolean algebra and it assumes that a logic condition or statement is true or false but cant be both true and false or partially false and partially true but " Electronics are admirably suited for this type of dual-state operation. For example if a circut is on then its true if it is said that a circut is in the off sate then its false this can bgy sysnthesized into a system

- To devise the electronic equivalent there are three basic satements of logic 

- The three statemen are AND, OR, and NOT. The And statements are true only if and only if the eithere or all of its logic condtitions are true, the Not statement  merely reverses the meanig of a logic statement menaing if this is true then its false

# Examples from the book

- if a switch is on then its true if a switch is off then its false which means 1 is true and 0 is false like binary code which can give you numbers  

- "we can now devise an electronic equivalent of the logical and statement by examining the various permutations for a two condition and statement:"

- The electronic on-off switch

- The numerical values 1 being true and 0 being off

these tables above which are also called permutations are known as truth tables 

## Electronic logic

- all three basic logic systems are simple transitor circuts and they all are assigned a symbol in order to to design and under stand the circuts

- Note a transistor is a semiconductor device with three connections, capable of amplification in addition to rectification

Here are all the refrenced designs and truth talbles that represent these designs

- but these three logic circuts can be combined to make another creating another logic circuts like nand and nor you can look at n and as both switches that turn the lights on no lights with no switches on means ittrue so false false true and then with both light switches one turns it on and the other on turns it off so both switches are on meaning true, true, = false and so on and so forth nor is kinda dificult to understand 

These are the truth tables that go with these logic statements

- Having three or more logic circuts make a logic system and to note the most basic logic system is the exclusive-or circut

## Number Systems

- Early man devised a number system that had 10 digits in them but this is based on any number of digits as seen before with one and zeros there is a two digit number system which is called bits bits are which are called binary digits then there is the octal binary system which is 8 digits and then then the Hexadecimal which is 16 digit system going from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F, and then 1011 12 13 this all lines up with another set of number 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, and 16
